# Philippine Open Disaster Specification

This is the repository for the Philippine Open Disaster Specification (PODS).
The PODS is a specification for describing disaster-related data in the
Philippines. Its development arises from the need to centralize and
standardize the multitude of reports and systems used by Philippine
government agencies for easy repackaging and distribution.

The PODS currently in the process of being written. Comments and
suggestions are welcome.

## Relation to the PAGASA Parser

The PAGASA Parser project will eventually shift to using the PODS in
the future to improve the abstraction of existing tropical cyclone
data and to make it easier to generate maps and other resources from
Tropical Cyclone Bulletin data.
