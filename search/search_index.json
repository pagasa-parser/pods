Rather, it should derive its information from reputable sources (e.g. PAGASA, PHIVOLCS, NDRRMC, including USGS, ESMC, and other international agencies) and provide a bundle of information that can then be consumed by anyone who needs it, be it an app installed on a civilian phone or non-governmental organizations.</p>"},{"location":"#contribution","title":"Contribution","text":"<p>This specification is open for comments, suggestions, revisions, and more.
