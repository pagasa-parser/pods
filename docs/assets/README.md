# Assets

## Diagrams.net files (.drawio)
Diagrams.net/draw.io files can be automatically exported using the `build.sh` script.
This script is automatically run by GitHub Actions prior to publishing.

If you still need to manually export, always export as SVG with `100` border,
embedded images, and embedded fonts.

## Adobe Illustrator files (.ai)
Export as SVG with `Responsive` and `Minify` options.
